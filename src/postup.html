        </header>
        <p>PostUp is a startup building an online community for remote workers and freelancers to
          share tips and advice. The team identified a growing need for reliable information about
          public places—like libraries and coffee shops—where remote workers can be productive.
          Essential details, such as stable Wi-Fi, outlets, and seating availability, are hard to
          find using tools like Google and Yelp. Additionally, I uncovered an additional issue at
          large—a lack of suitable public
          workspaces. As a result, many waste valuable time searching for
          and visiting unsuitable locations, leaving them frustrated and unproductive.</p>

        <p>
          On Day 1, I kicked off the sprint by reviewing the limited research materials provided by
          PostUp. This included a <a href="assets/files/PostUp/PostUpResearchSlideDeck.pdf">

          </a> with 8 interview quotes, a user persona, and a single
          recorded interview. With no access to additional research or users, I extracted the most
          relevant insights to guide my design decisions. Here's what I found:

        <ul class="mb-24">

          <li>They rely on online reviews and photos, which are often unreliable</li>
          <li>Many arrive at workspaces only to find no seating available</li>
          <li>Their needs vary by tasks: quiet work, meetings, calls, and duration of stay</li>

          <p>With such a small research sample size, I began
            struggling to determine the flexibility and

            At this point, I figured functionalities like customizable presets would address this,

              existing products, designs, or concepts related to the
              sprint's problem. They offer inspiration, diverse

              solutions for the sprint's objectives.

        <p>Drawing from my lightning demos, I brainstormed solutions by diving into a Crazy Eights
          exercise, where I sketched a frame per minute over 8 minutes. I felt a bit intimidated at
          first, but I ended up really enjoying the process and found it really productive. All of
          these sketches inspired the remainder of my design process!</p>

          her process of elimination. </p>

          On day 3, I expanded the 3-panel storyboard into a detailed comic-style narrative of

                Being in a new city, Nina likely has little knowledge of her
                surroundings, so she's probably keen to explore nearby
                workspaces. Therefore, the ideal home screen should show Nina
                a map that visually displays available options around her
                current location.<br />

                  Create a 'Search page' that allows people to conduct a 'New

                With a new 'Search' page, I was able to display the details on
                the preset filters to ensure transparency. As for my conflict
                regarding whether or not Nina should be able to adjust filters
                immediately after task selection, after reviewing my user
                research, I realized most people share the same preferences
                across all tasks! Being taken to a filters page each time Nina
                selects a preset could be counterproductive. She can also just
                conduct a new search. Besides, testing may reveal the ideal
                flow!

                The final highlight of my storyboard evolution was adding a
                'Reviews' section for each workspace. After Nina learns about
                the workspace's details, she might want to see what other
                people have to say or seek more details, especially since
                that's what she's used to doing with her existing tools. For a
                more intuitive experience, users may navigate between the
                pages by swiping horizontally.

                    allowed basically. And like, if that was just exactly what I
                    was looking for, then this would be the perfect place, and I
                    wouldn't have to scroll down any further and waste an extra

          I also brainstormed a monetization strategy that can increase business revenue
          streams for PostUp. Considering the growing trend
          toward remote work, I see a promising opportunity for a mutually
          beneficial collaboration between PostUp and local businesses. Therefore, I

          Overall, my strategies aim to establish a sustainable revenue model that enhances the
          overall remote working experience throughout their user journey. This
          collaboration could incentivize businesses to enhance their
          amenities, catering to remote workers and in turn enriching the
          overall user experience for Postup subscribers.
          In sum, these strategies offer additional revenue streams for
          PostUp while boosting the app's value proposition for both users and business partners.

        <h3>Shipping the MVP</h3>
        <p class="mb-40">
          If I had more time, I would conduct another round of usability
          testing to validate my
          iterations. I would also
          <span class="semibold">further optimize the user experience</span>
          and
          <span class="semibold">iterate screens for the rewards system, exclusive promotions, and
            reservation system</span>. I would
          <span class="semibold">extend and complete the user flow</span>
          to include <span class="semibold">reserving a table</span> and the
          final interaction with the app—<span class="semibold">earn PostUp points</span>
          in-store with an purchase at an official PostUp partner location. If I had a team to ship
          this prototype, I would implement the designs from my monetization strategy and develop
          the user flow for PostUp partners to integrate them into the ecosystem.<br />

        <h3>Personal growth</h3>
        <p>
          A long-term goal of mine is to increasingly streamline my
          design process. I aim to learn and develop efficient design
          strategies to streamline the product design cycle, maximizing
          company resources and reducing business costs. In other words, I
          want to
          <span class="semibold">learn to design as efficiently as possible to cut down business
            costs and accelerate business growth</span>. Given the success of testing via verbal
          walkthroughs, I want to learn more cost-effective
          ways of usability testing.<br />

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
        </header>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p class="mb-40">This was my first time conducting a design sprint, and writing this case
          study helped
          me
          realize how much I've grown since my previous project, TasteBuds, which has been a very
          affirming experience. Challenging myself to develop a monetization strategy for a
          scalable, resilient product was incredibly rewarding. Leveraging my business acumen to
          create a user-friendly and profitable product was really exciting. This definitely
          reinforced my choice of product design
          over solely UX design, given my diverse skill set and appreciation for the entire
          product lifecycle.</p>
        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <h4>User behavior and expectations</h4>
        <p class="mb-40">As I progress as a product designer, understanding user behavior and
          expectations has
          empowered me to anticipate needs and optimize usability tests. My favorite parts of
          this project was further streamlining my
          design process and navigating project constraints, especially in creating more
          effective user flows and designing cost-effective
          usability tests to maximize business revenue.</p>
        <h4>Expanding on TasteBuds</h4>
        <p>
          Designing PostUp gave me the opportunity to expand my prior case
          study on my previous project <em>TasteBuds</em>—a social
          recommendation mobile app that connects diners with trusted
          friends and personalized suggestions. This sprint validated my
          research and test insights on user behavior and motivations in TasteBuds. Both
          studies taught me the importance of novelty and innovation to
          enhance user engagement and prioritize user-centricity. This
          experience definitely reinforced my commitment to research and
          anticipatory design, boosting my confidence in pursuing
          innovation! <br />
        </p>
        <p>Overall, this was a very rewarding experience, and I can't wait to apply my learnings
          in my future projects!</p>
