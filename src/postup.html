        <p>
          With the rise of remote work, PostUp—a startup focused on building an online community for
          freelancers—observed a growing need for reliable information about public workspaces on
          their platform.
          Remote workers often struggle to find suitable locations, such as libraries or coffee
          shops,
          wasting time on unsuitable visits due to inadequate online resources. In addition, there
          is a scarcity of suitable locations.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary-text mt-32">
          How can I connect remote workers with suitable public workspaces and
          drive PostUp's business objectives?

          <p>Drawing from my lightning demos, I conducted a Crazy 8s exercise, sketching 8 frames in

            Among my Crazy 8's I identified one screen to be the most critical screen and developed
            it into a 3-panel storyboard. I chose the
            "search results" screen (the middle screen below) because it is the
            central hub for remote workers to compare and decide on a workspace.

                the user journey. This screen would later be incorporated into
                a 3-panel storyboard, which would visualize the step before
                and after the critical screen.

              Since accessing relevant information is a remote worker's primary challenge, my key

                Being in a new city, Nina likely has little knowledge of her
                surroundings, so she's probably keen to explore nearby
                workspaces. Therefore, the ideal home screen should show Nina
                a map that visually displays available options around her
                current location.<br />

                regarding whether or not Nina should be able to adjust filters
                immediately after task selection, after reviewing my user
                research, I realized most people share the same preferences
                across all tasks! Being taken to a filters page each time Nina
                selects a preset could be counterproductive. She can also just
                conduct a new search. Besides, testing may reveal the ideal
                flow!

                The final highlight of my storyboard evolution was adding a
                'Reviews' section for each workspace. After Nina learns about
                the workspace's details, she might want to see what other
                people have to say or seek more details, especially since
                that's what she's used to doing with her existing tools. For a
                more intuitive experience, users may navigate between the
                pages by swiping horizontally.

            <p>Previously, I thought Nina's journey ended with selecting a

              the journey doesn't end until she's settled into a workspace. </p>
            <p>After some reflection,

          While this was very helpful as I tackled the screens, sadly, the
          dilemma I experienced on day 3 did not get fully resolved. I
          encountered a similar issue while trying to anticipate different
          user behaviors and potential alternate routes. Realizing I lacked
          sufficient time to cover them all, I decided against prototyping
          alternate routes and planned to rely on testing to reveal them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The usability testing I conducted with my first high-fidelity
          prototype consisted of 5 users.<br />

            validate user interactions. For example, I asked users, "Without touching the screen,
            how would you proceed to search for a workspace?" This approach allowed me to gather
            insights on intuitive navigation paths and prioritize features accordingly.</p>

            Overall, the feedback I received was overwhelmingly positive.
            Participants praised the user-friendly navigation, quick access to
            critical information, and visual design. They didn't find any
            critical information missing, but some suggested including
            additional helpful details that they don't find in their current
            methods, such as lighting and restroom capacity. Everyone
            completed their task very quickly and successfully.

          <p>
            The only errors occurred were some confusion with the copy and
            icons, which is reasonable given how much of the information
            included in this prototype are not typically found in other apps.

            Based on the usability testing results, I brainstormed potential
            strategies aligned with the startup's requirement for a $5.99
            monthly user subscription fee to increase business revenue
            streams. My focus involves brainstorming new features that drive
            spaner engagement with businesses featured on PostUp, thus
            amplifying revenue generation. Considering the growing trend
            toward remote work, I see a promising opportunity for a mutually
            beneficial collaboration between PostUp and local businesses. This
            collaboration could incentivize businesses to enhance their
            amenities, catering to remote workers and in turn enriching the
            overall user experience for Postup subscribers. Therefore, I
            propose an
            <span class="semibold">additional subscription and referral model that invites

            The primary challenge I encountered revolved around adapting
            innovative solutions to user expectations, ensuring a seamless
            user experience. For instance, selecting icons for work
            environment amenities when many required icons don't exist in
            current products. Similarly, the challenge include crafting visual
            designs to convey novel information like labeling search results
            with distinct amenity icons, indicating 'available seats,' and
            identifying 'suitable tasks'. To overcome this, I relied on
            usability testing to reveal their expectations and iterated
            designs accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, I found myself occasionally dedicating excessive time to
            UI design, which contradicted the principles of an MVP-focused
            design sprint. To address this, I embraced time constraints and
            used rapid ideation techniques such as 'Crazy 8's' to accelerate
            and fine-tune my design process.
